                            Q: What is bouldering, and how is it different from regular climbing?
                        </strong>
                        <p>
                            A: Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that involves climbing short routes, or "problems," without the use of ropes or harnesses. It focuses on strength, technique, and problem-solving. Unlike traditional climbing, bouldering is done at lower heights, typically up to 15 feet, with the emphasis on power and agility.
